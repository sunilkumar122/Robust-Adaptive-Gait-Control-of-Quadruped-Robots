# Robust-Adaptive-Gait-Control-of-Quadruped-Robots
This paper presents a robust adaptive control framework for quadruped robots using ZMP-based stability with neural network–enhanced sliding mode and LQR control. The approach ensures stable trotting, precise gait tracking, and strong disturbance rejection in flat-terrain simulations.
